      Designing an artificially intelligent machine that can think, learn, reason and experience, sounds like a dream coming true, since mankind tries to create a controllable image of itself. Even if we come closer and closer by the developing technology, there are some questions and obstacles to overcome. For that we have to understand how our structures work to make it possible to design and translate those structures to an intelligent computer that takes over our functions.

    <div class="text">
      Furthermore we have to try to understand how the artificial intelligent system will react and perceive people and reverse we have to understand how a complete artificial intelligent system would be received and perceived by people.

      Psychologists study and try to retrace the mental processes and behavior of humans. Artificial Psychology is then inferred the study of the mental processes of an Artificial Intelligence System. Artificial Psychology is a theoretical discipline, proposed first by Dan Curtis in 1963. The theory claims that there must be tree conditions fulfilled, autonomous decision making on a new, abstract and incomplete information base, capability to reprogramming itself and resolving own programming conflicts and if the first two conditions are met in situations that were not part of the original operational system, there must be put Artificial Psychology into place for such systems.

    AI & Emotions
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      What seems to distinguish us humans form machines is on the first thought the emotions that carry us, but also on artificial intelligence systems emotions are a part that programmers and developers should consider. In our daily lives emotions play a big role, they can get in our ways when emotions overload our rational thinking, but they can also be helpful. Thinking of an urgent situation makes it more clear. Such a situation makes us focus and prioritize on the important factors. The questions in link with and translated to artificial intelligence systems is if the system is overload, can it determine to return to optimal performance and can it recognize, e.g. the urgency, increase the required resources and deduce the correct or best following steps? These considerations also include the already existing sub disciplines Artificial Cognition, which refers to how the artificially intelligent machine learns, integrates, recalls, and uses the information that it receives and Artificial Intuition, where the system can keep multiple sets of information active in parallel and in the end, more often than not, the information that is ‘most likely’ to be correct wins, similar to what happens in humans, too. That adds to the tie of intuition and emotions. Would it be possible to implement emotions to nonhuman systems? While humans are driven by needs and arousals which lead to emotions to be fulfilled or not, artificial intelligence systems could or should be equipped with „emotion-like“ features to deal with the world around it to reach human-like problem solving with the concept of an autonomic nervous system and for example by displaying emotions to the user. The question that arises by that is how close do we want a machine to our image.

    AI & Intelligence Perception
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    Interacting with artificial intelligence systems in practice means that the human starts an interaction with the machine, to that point not reverse wise. Thats why it should be considered how the interactor, or user, perceives the interaction. Humans mindlessly apply social rules and expectations to computers and respond to cues triggers various scripts, labels and expectations from the past rather than on all the relevant clues of the present. How AI is presented to humans  affects how AI is perceived, for example if the system has a name and is understandable, helpful, pleasant and reliable. The perception and acceptance of artificial intelligent machines can also depend on the functions they carry out, for example if they are used to detect threats of security or replace human tasks and work for automatization.
