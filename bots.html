      A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, chatterbox, Artificial Conversational Entity) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program" target="_blank">computer program</a> which conducts a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation" target="_blank">conversation</a> via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing test</a>. Chatbots are typically used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_system" target="_blank">dialog systems</a> for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">natural language processing</a> systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database" target="_blank">database</a>.

      Turing Test:
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      The Turing test, developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a> in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">exhibit intelligent behaviour</a> equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_understanding" target="_blank">judge natural language conversations</a> between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses.

      Timeline:

    <div class="text">
      1950 Alan Turing’s famous artice „ Computing Machinery and Intelligence“ first introduced what today is called the Turing Test<br>
      1966 Joseph Weizenbaum’s program ELIZA seemed to be able to fool users into believing they were conversing with a real human<br>
      1972 psychiatrist Kenneth Colby introduced PARRY: While ELIZA was a tongue-in-cheek simulation of a Rogerian therapist, PARRY attempted to simulate a person with paranoid schizophrenia.<br>
      1984 a book called „The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed“ was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter<br>
      2006 A.L.I.C.E , Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E<br>
        <ol>
          <li> A.L.I.C.E. utilises a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966.</li>
          <li> Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held</li>
        </ol>
      Since 2000 chatbots play a major role in many different industries and serve many different purposes<br>
      2008 Alaska Airlines „Jenn“<br>
      2011 Expedia introduces virtual costumer service agent on their website<br>
      2017 Israeli company Snatchbot launched a chatbot creation website, which claimed the capability of building bots sentiment analysis<br>

      the US does prove itself to be a market of early adopters and innovators as well as home to some of the worlds leading tech companies. The popularity in Asia can be suggested to be because the high density of mobile devices and therefore high messengers usage in this area. What is interesting though is the lack of prediction for the African market to take off. Given Africa is one of the strongest emerging markets, with both businesses and consumers mostly working via mobile rather than desktop, it would make sense for chatbots to thrive in the African market. Another location that wasn’t an option in the survey but would have surely been backed by innovators is South/Latin America. Again another market that is working predominately from mobile, fuelled by cheaper devices and mobile data accessibility.

      Although broken into incredibly vague options, chatbot innovators confirm what is almost common sense. Chatbots will be most promising across customer service and eCommerce industries. Thos who responded other enthusiastically predicted chatbots will be popular everywhere.<br><br>
      Most respondents agreed we have not yet reached the peak in popularity of chatbots. Most predicted things to kick off in a year (45%), closely followed by 2–5 years (40%).<br><br>
      Only 15% backed that the time is now which ultimately means that even though the innovation we have right now is exciting we can and will do a lot more with chatbots in the coming years.<br><br>
      Just a hype?

      Jason Pontin, journalist for the Technology Review Magazin on the current situation of chatbots and AI:<br>
      “Chatbots can give a more-or-less convincing simulacrum of conversation, but really fluent conversation will require common sense”<br>
      “Chess is easy. No one was surprised that A.I. could master chess, except for chess players. But to get me to be a more devoted Maroon 5 fan would be magic, because I detest Maroon 5.”
